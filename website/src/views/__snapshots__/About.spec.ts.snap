exports[`About text is present and correct 1`] = `"Coming into college, I had no idea what my future held. The first year consisted of bouncing between different majors, contemplating how each of them might play to one of my strengths. This only served to play into a running joke within my family that I was a "Renaissance Man", with too many interests to actually pick one.  Luckily, I remembered an internship before college where I did some Java development. Realizing how fun it was to design and tackle a problem head on, I switched to the College of Engineering at NC State University with a concentration in Computer Science. From then on I developed a passion for all aspects of Software Engineering, from Agile principles to database, API and front-end design. My previous Psychology major came into use as a minor, aiding me in front-end design and creating ethical software.  This passion lead to two amazing internships at InMotionNow as a QA Engineer and Volvo as a Software Support Engineer. Both of these experiences prepared me immensely for my work at Fidelity Investments as a researcher, exploring blockchain, distributed systems and the future of technology. After a year of research, I looked within Fidelity for something that would bring me back to some of the core Software Engineering tenants I loved. This brought me to a role at Fidelity Charitable, building a platform that helps people support the charities they love.  During the COVID-19 Pandemic, I switched to work as a Senior Full-Stack Engineer for Bandwidth Inc. building a next-gen WebRTC platform, as well as leading development on a new MFA solution and API Adapter. I received immense exposure to CI/CD, automation, AWS Cloud Development, and distributed application knowledge. This spurred my love for cloud technology and an appreciation for the operations side of development. Unfortunately, the company itself was not a great fit for me, and I missed the company culture that I had been a part of at Fidelity.  I currently work as a Principal Full-Stack Engineer for Fidelity Investments building the future of AI chatbot and ML tools.  In my free time, I love to travel and cook as well as sing and create music."`;
